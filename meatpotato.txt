984559,I visited last night on New Year's Eve and ordered the fried pickles (my fave). They took almost 45 mins.  The waitress also didn't offer an explanation or offer to refill our drinks while we waited.  The table next to us ordered them as well and they were delivered in 10 mins.  Very disappointed.
984560,Place looks awesome.
984561,Veuve and fried pickles.
984562,"Hello Meat and Potatoes Restaurant, Can you please add seasoning to your dishes? Thank you."
984564,Worst service ever. Totally rude staff. Don't go.

Great Mac n Cheese
Tuna tacos were terribly salty and inedible
Salmon was cooked perfectly but kimchi took away from flavor"
984566,"Soo good!!! Love the Bone marrow, yummmmm. Deff should try if in Pittsburgh."
984567,"The tartare was my favorite appetizer.  I like bone marrow, however to have to add thr toppings each time doesnt it make it enjoyable.  I've had better.  The pate was a bit sweet for my taste."

984595,Always great.
984596,"No valet parking. 

Chicken & Waffles are only on the lunch menu."
984597,Atmospherically be prepared to feel like you're eating in the middle of a Hollister retail store with the brain thumping bass and mindless house music in the background. Just a tad too much for Sunday brunch.
984598,"Really good drinks, and probably the best mussels in town!"
984599,"A little wait, but Outstanding food."
984600,Don't eat at Meat and Potatos in Pittsburgh the staff is RUDE!!!
